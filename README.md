# abcm2ps-edits

The goal of this repository is to discover specific mechanisms in the various
open source ABC parsers and try to bring them into the original _abcm2ps_
source. A secondary goal is to develop a binary with specific functionality in
support of a GitHub Action for converting ABC notation to PDF without the need
of a specific OS, specific programs, or build steps other than copying a
GitHub template.
